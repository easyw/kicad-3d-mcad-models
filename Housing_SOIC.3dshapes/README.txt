Notes:
The 3D models are:
- parametric models coming from technical datasheet
- FreeCAD 1:1 model (optional)
- STEP 1:1 model
- STEP 1:1 model with with text on it (optional)
- VRML 1/2.54 model (to fit perfectly kicad 3d-viewer with scale 1,1,1)
- footprint file with right orientation, scale and 3D model associated
  to the official kicad distribution
- STEP model fused in single object

HowTo:
just copy the .3Dshapes DIRECTORY in your 3D prefix folder
(e.g. in windows C:\kicad\packages3d_MCAD or in Linux/OSX ~/packages3d_MCAD )
resulting in:
    windows
    C:\kicad\packages3d_MCAD\Capacitors_SMD.3dshapes
    linux/osx
    ~/packages3d_MCAD/Capacitors_SMD.3dshapes
    with all *.wrl and *.step files inside
    
set your KISYS3DMOD var to e.g. C:\kicad\packages3d_MCAD
It is also possible to just override kicad standard 3D modules, 
but consider that an update or a new installation of kicad
will overrite all MCAD models

to set KISYS3DMOD variable in windows open a command prompt in Administrator mode
and digit 
    SETX KISYS3DMOD C:\kicad\packages3d_MCAD

in ubuntu open a shell bash and digit
    export KISYS3DMOD ~\packages3d_MCAD
    
to export your Kicad board with components to 3D MCAD environment
just use kicad StepUp exporter and kicad StepUp tools at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kicadstepup/
